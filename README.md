# Vending-Machine

This is a console-based application that simulates a vending machine. The application displays a list of products in two rows, each with three products. 
The user can select a product by typing its name in the console. If the product is in stock, the price of the product and the amount to be paid will be displayed.
If the vending machine has enough coins to give change, the user will be asked to pick up the product.
If not, a message will be displayed on the screen saying that the machine cannot give change. 
If the selected product is out of stock, a message will be displayed on the screen indicating that it is out of stock, and the initial menu will be displayed.

Usage:

Run the application.
The vending machine menu will be displayed showing the list of products:
